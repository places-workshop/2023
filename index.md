The increasingly concurrent and parallel landscape of hardware and software
infrastructures demands the exploration and understanding of a wide variety of
foundational and practical ideas. The **International Workshop on Programming
Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software (PLACES)**
is dedicated to work in this area.

PLACES offers a forum for researchers from different fields to exchange new
ideas about these challenges to modern and future programming, where concurrency
and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern. PLACES has been a
satellite workshop of ETAPS since 2009, and is now well established as an ETAPS
event. The PLACES topic is central and combines well with the main conferences
of ETAPS, in particular with ESOP. 

PLACES has had 13 previous iterations, most of which co-located with ETAPS; this
will be the 14th edition.
