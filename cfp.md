# PLACES 2023 Call for Papers

* Submission deadline: 15 February 2023, AoE
* Author notification: 17 March 2023, AoE
* Workshop: 22 April 2023

Submission site: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=places2023>

To contact the programme chairs: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>

## Submissions

Submissions are invited in the general area of programming language approaches
to concurrency, communication and distribution, ranging from foundational
issues, through language implementations, to applications and case studies.
Submissions are peer-reviewed by a minimum of three reviewers, with the aim of
allocating at least one expert reviewer.  Submissions must  be
formatted in [**EPTCS style**](http://style.eptcs.org/). 

The proceedings of PLACES 2023 will be published as a volume of EPTCS _(to be
confirmed)_.

We welcome the following types of submission:

  * **Research papers** with a maximum length of **8 pages** (with no
    restriction on bibliography or appendices, which the reviewers are not
    required to read).  Submitted research papers are reviewed based on their
    **novelty**, **clarity**, and **technical soundness**.  They must not be
    submitted for publication elsewhere, and if accepted, they will appear in
    the PLACES proceedings.

  * **Talk proposals** with a maximum length of **2 pages** (with no restriction
    on bibliography or appendices, which the reviewers are not required to
    read).  Talk proposal may present ongoing work, and work already published
    elsewhere.  Accepted talk proposals will be presented at the workshop, but
    will not appear in the PLACES proceedings. 

## Topics

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Design and implementation of programming languages with first class
    concurrency and communication primitives
  * Models for concurrent and distributed systems, such as process algebra and
    automata, and their mechanisation in proof assistants 
  * Behavioural types, including session types
  * Concurrent data types, objects and actors
  * Verification and program analysis methods for safe and secure concurrent and
    distributed software 
  * Interface and contract languages for communication and distribution
  * Applications to microservices, sensor networks, scientific computing, HPC,
    blockchains, robotics
  * Concurrency and communication in event processing and business process
    management

## Special Issue

Authors of selected papers from PLACES 2023 will be invited to submit extended
versions of their workshop papers to a special issue of [Information and
Computation](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-computation) or
[JLAMP](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming)
or [FAC](https://dl.acm.org/journal/fac).
